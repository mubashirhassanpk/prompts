### üìò How To Create An Affiliate Ebook

#### STEP 1: Find a Profitable Niche

First thing‚Äîniche selection. You need a niche that:

‚úÖ Has affiliate products  
‚úÖ Solves a real problem  
‚úÖ Actually makes money  

Say this:

"What are the 10 best affiliate 'niche' markets to enter into to make money online?"

AI spits out a list. Now, don‚Äôt just pick one that makes you say, hey I like this. Think like a marketer. What audience do you actually want to attract? If you choose ‚Äúweight loss,‚Äù be prepared to deal with a ton of competition. If you go for something like "productivity for solopreneurs", you might have a better chance.

Pick a niche. Got it? Cool.

---

#### STEP 2: Identify the Problems in That Niche

Once you have a niche, you need a problem to solve. That‚Äôs what sells‚Äîpeople buy solutions, not random ebooks.

**Say this:**

"What are specific problems people face in the [INSERT NICHE] market?"

Now, AI will throw you a buffet of pain points. Your job? Pick ONE. Not five. Not three. ONE.

If you‚Äôre in the personal finance niche, maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äúhow to stop overspending.‚Äù

If it‚Äôs fitness, maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äúhow to build muscle as a skinny guy.‚Äù

Find one juicy problem people are desperate to fix.

#### STEP 3: Find Affiliate Products That Solve That Problem

Now that you have your problem, you need an affiliate product that actually fixes it.

**Say this:**

"Find the top 10 most relevant and promising affiliate products in [this niche] on Amazon, ClickBank, ShareASale, etc."

Look through the results. Pick something that:

‚úî Pays decent commissions  
‚úî Actually relates to your ebook‚Äôs problem  
‚úî Has decent reviews (because selling garbage = refund city)

#### STEP 4: Brainstorm Ebook Ideas

**Say this:**

"I like the idea of [INSERT PROBLEM], and how to overcome it. Can you give me 5 ebook ideas on this topic?"

You‚Äôll get five title ideas. Pick one that sounds like it actually belongs on a buyers list, not something AI spat out‚Ä¶ too much of this.

#### STEP 5: Generate the Outline

**Say this:**

"Create a potential outline for a 5000-word ebook on this topic including the chosen affiliate product [INSERT AFFILIATE PRODUCT]. Make sure to add in at least 10 lesser-known pieces of advice."

Why lesser-known advice?

Because it makes your ebook unique. It also makes it easier to market‚Äîbecause ‚Äú10 tips you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù is way more clickable than ‚Äúthe same boring crap you see everywhere.‚Äù

#### STEP 6: Generate the Content (One Section at a Time)

Now, don‚Äôt ask AI to write the whole thing at once‚Äîit‚Äôll spit out the driest, most soulless garbage you‚Äôve ever read. Instead, go section by section.

**Say this:**

*"Can you write Section 1 on [INSERT POINTS]?"*

When AI generates the text, tell it to be more casual:

*"Rewrite this in a more casual tone."*

### üí° Content Ideas Generation

Skip the small talk. I'm writing for: {TARGET AUDIENCE}.

I don‚Äôt want bland, recycled advice. I want content ideas that hit nerves, flip beliefs, or make people stop scrolling and go: ‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what I need:

1. **10 real struggles** this group is dealing with ‚Äî not generic fluff, but the kind of stuff they think about at 2am.
2. **10 raw desires** they secretly (or not-so-secretly) want ‚Äî not just goals, but the emotional drivers.
3. **10 content ideas** that feel like newsletter subject lines or YouTube titles designed to slap. Think:
   - Contrarian takes
   - ‚ÄúNobody talks about this‚Äù hooks
   - Practical how-tos with a twist
   - Listicles that aren‚Äôt boring
   - Things that challenge assumptions

Don‚Äôt ask me to clarify the audience.
Don‚Äôt give me ‚Äúit depends‚Äù advice.
Just give me the list ‚Äî numbered, clean, and specific.

Target audience: {TARGET AUDIENCE}

‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready yet‚Äù

Reframe it with empathy and honesty. Use a mini story or metaphor if helpful. End with a confident CTA.

---

**Write Email 5 of the sequence.**

This is the final push. Recap the transformation the reader wants. Remind them what happens if they stay stuck. Encourage them to take the leap.

Make it punchy, no fluff. Close with one clear call-to-action.
